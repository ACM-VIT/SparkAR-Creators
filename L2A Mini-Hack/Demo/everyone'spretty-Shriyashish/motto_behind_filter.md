# Everyone's Pretty!


**This filter is made mainly to remind every person around the globe to remember that beauty comes in all colours and sizes.**


Every time someone asks the mirror,
> "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the prettiest of them all?"

The mirror simply blinks and shows that person's face. So don't let anyone tell you otherwise!


I hope my motto behind the filter makes someone feel good about themselves. 
That's all from my side.
Thank you!
Happy Augmenting. :D
